						<h4>DEMOCRATIC PARTICIPATION AND REFORM IN BANGLADESH (DPR)</h4>

<p>
Democratic Participation and Reform, a five-year $12 million democracy and governance project implemented by Democracy International (DI) and funded jointly by USAID and UKaid, has three objectives: to increase grassroots participation, with a focus on women and youth; enhance information access and utilization; and improve the environment for responsive politics. Although the past four years have been plagued by ongoing political crises, DI has supported over 125,000 grassroots party members to generate momentum for democratic participation and political party reform. Though its regional women and youth centers in all seven regions of Bangladesh, DI has a unique advantage in engaging women and youth and liaising with political leaders across the country.
</p>
<h4>Enhancing Grassroots Participation</h4>
<p>
Although women lead the three largest political parties in Bangladesh, they remain largely absent from other decision-making positions within political parties. The Representation of the People Order (amendment) of 2009 requires parties to include 33% women in all main party committees by 2020 which is an exceptional opportunity to expand women’s political leadership throughout the country. DI is conducting advocacy, capacity building, networking, and a comprehensive media campaign through the Narir Joye Shobar Joy, “When Women Win, We All Win” campaign to support and promote women’s political leadership. The campaign boasts a growing multiparty network of over 10,000 women leaders across the country and has already assisted parties to include over 4,000 women leaders in 337 main grassroots leadership committees. In the committees that have received DI assistance, women’s participation has increased from 2.6% to 20.3%.
</p>

<p>
Political parties largely marginalize their youth leaders and lacking more positive avenues for political expression, many young political activists have been at the front of violent protests in recent years. To help constructively engage young people with national and regional party leaders and ensure that the issues youth face are addressed in party and national policies, DI has developed a Young Leaders Fellowship Program for young political party activists. Each six-month fellowship includes a group of 25-30 men and women representing all four major parties and all seven regions of the country. The fellows attend a three-day training seminar in Dhaka each month and then return to their home districts to apply the training while working with senior party leaders to organize events in their districts. To date, 101 young political leaders have graduated from the program and remain active in the Fellow Alumni Association and over 3,200 young grassroots party activists have participated in program activities. DI is currently working its fifth cohort of fellows.
</p>

<h4>Improving Information Access and Utilization</h4>
<p>
Bangladeshi political parties have yet to institutionalize the use of opinion research, nor have they internalized the need to connect research with policy and strategy. In order to fill the gap, DI conducts public opinion polls that are designed both as a long-term longitudinal study, as well as specifically for parties. At the same time, DI is assisting parties in institutionalizing and making decisions based on public opinion research and quantitative research data. In 2014, DI launched the Bangladesh Barometer (http://bangladeshbarometer.org), an interactive online platform that includes all survey data collected by DI. DI also supports its research activities through the CATSS (Computer Assisted Telephone Survey System) center, the first of its kind in Bangladesh, where ongoing telephone surveys are conducted for political parties and other stakeholders.
</p>

<h4>Improving the Environment for Responsive Politics</h4>
<p>
To improve and facilitate coordination on reform initiatives between national party organizations and historically marginalized political groups, particularly women and youth, DI is engaging parties in more sophisticated and strategic constituency outreach. In 2014, for the first time in over eight years, major political parties began holding elections, called “councils”, for their internal leadership positions.  DI is helping parties hold district and city level conferences prior to the councils in order to help identify leadership candidates, develop democratic council procedures, and most importantly to generate momentum at all levels of the party for new grassroots leaders, particularly women leaders as required by the RPO law. As of late-January 2015, DI has organized 213 regional party conferences and 173 party councils for local political party activists and leaders, attracting a total of 112,569 participants from 62 of the country’s 64 districts. DI is also assisting parties to create public web portals that already include data for over 50,000 party members and are helping facilitate communications between parties and their members.

<p>
DI utilizes two data collection methodologies to conduct it quantitative research: face-to-face and telephone surveys. DI subcontracts with local vendors to conduct face-to-face surveys, using a nationally representative, multi-stage random sampling technique. For face-to-face surveys, DI generally conducts interviews with between 1,500 and 2,500 adults. The margin of error for face-to-face surveys is generally between +/- 2.0% and 2.5% with a 95% confidence level. DI requires strict quality control protocols from its vendors, demanding at least 30% of all interviews are verified. DI pre-tests its surveys among a wide variety of demographics to assess clarity, comprehension and translation quality.
</p>

<p>
DI conducts telephone surveys using its proprietary Computer Assisted Telephone Survey System (CATSS).  Samples are drawn by randomly generating mobile phone numbers from all six mobile phone operating companies proportional to market share.  For telephone surveys, DI generally conducts interviews with between 800 and 1,500 adults. The margin of error for telephone surveys is generally between +/- 2.5% and 3.5% with a 95% confidence level. Due to disproportionate levels of mobile access between men and women and in urban and rural areas, survey data is weighted to account for under-representation of women and citizens in rural areas. DI conducts internal quality control, verifying 30% of all telephone interviews. It also pretests all questionnaires and provides regular training for its interviewing staff.
